## 📌 Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting house prices using **Machine Learning techniques**.
It involves analyzing housing features, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and training multiple ML models to forecast property prices.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, distributions, heatmaps)
✅ Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
✅ Model evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE comparison)
✅ Visualizations for insights

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** 🐍
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Notebook:** Jupyter / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load dataset (`house price prediction.csv`)
2. Handle missing values & feature engineering
3. Perform **EDA** with plots
4. Train ML models for prediction
5. Compare performance metrics
6. Generate final insights

---

## 📈 Results

* Identified key features influencing house prices
* Random Forest performed best with higher accuracy than Linear Regression
* Visualizations provided clear insights into price-driving factors
